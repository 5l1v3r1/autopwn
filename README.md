# autopwn

Specify targets and run sets of tools against them

autopwn is designed to make a pentester's life easier and more consistent
by allowing them to specify tools they would like to run against targets,
without having to type them in a shell or write a script. This tool will
probably be useful during certain exams as well..

## Running

To use autopwn, simply fork the GitHub repository and run autopwn.py

## Usage

autopwn supports a number of options, including:

```
-t <target_file>          Required. The file containing the
                          targets
-a <assessment_type>      Optional. Specify assessment name
                          to run. Autopwn will not prompt to
                          run tools with this option
-d <assessment_directory> Optional. Specify assessment directory
-i                        Deprecated (and buggy). Optional.
                          Ignore missing binary conditions
-r                        Deprecated (and buggy). Optional.
                          Ignore tool rulesets
-s                        Optional. Run tools in screen session
-p                        Optional. Run tools in parallel regardless
                          of assessment or global parallel option
```
